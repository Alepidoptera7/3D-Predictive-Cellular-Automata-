# 3D-Predictive-Cellular-Automata-
Cellular automaton to predict neoplastic cell cluster growth. In operation, the automaton is comparable to a 3-d Conway's Game of Life, however its parameters and behaviors of 'choice' account for the randomness of outcomes in a chaotic inter-cellular environment.
